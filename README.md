```

The following external libraries are used:
- simongog/sdsl-lite
- vigna/sux


### Download

To download all the necessary source codes:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/itomomoti/ShapedSlp.git
```


### Compile

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```


### Usage

The following executables for benchmarks are created. See help by running without options.

```sh
./SlpEncBuild
./SubstrBenchmark
```


### Examples
`./SlpEncBuild` builds SLP encoding and outputs it to file. Input SLPs under the format of the output of NavarroRepair [https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/âˆ¼gnavarro/software/repair.tgz] or Bigrepair [https://gitlab.com/manzai/bigrepair] are supported.
```sh
# build encoding for method SelfShapedSlp_SdSd_Sd
./SlpEncBuild -i path_to_data/chr19x1000.fa -o ds_fname -e SelfShapedSlp_SdSd_Sd -f Bigrepair
# With "-e All", build encodings for all methods. The file name for each method is prefixed by the string given by -o option and suffixed by the method name
./SlpEncBuild -i path_to_data/chr19x1000.fa -o chr_ -e All -f Bigrepair
```

`./SubstrBenchmark` runs benchmarks to test substring extraction speed of SLP encodings created by `./SlpEncBuild`
```sh
# test substring extraction speed
./SubstrBenchmark -i ds_fname -e SelfShapedSlp_SdSd_Sd -n 10000 -l 10 -j 1000000
# With "-e All", test all methods. The base name should be given by -i option.
./SubstrBenchmark -i chr_ -e All -n 10000 -l 10 --dummy_flag 1 -j 1000000
```


### Methods

The following encoding methods of SLPs with random access are implemented.
- PlainSlp: An input SLP is converted into a binary SLP so that its derivation tree becomes a binary tree. Then the left/right child of variables are stored plainly in FixedBitLenCode or IncBitLenCode. Expansion lengths of variables are stored independently.
- PoSlp: The encoding method proposed in [Maruyama et al., Fully-Online Grammar Compression, SPIRE 2013] based on post order SLPs.
- SelfShapedSlp: The encoding method proposed in [Gagie et al., Practical Random Access to SLP-Compressed Texts, SPIRE 2020] that utilizes the expansion length of a variable for shaving off the information to identify the variable.
- ShapedSlp: A prototype of SelfShapedSlp.


### Components

Basic data structures used as components of encoding methods can be switched by template arguments.
- FixedBitLenCode: A vector that uses fixed-length bits for each element. By default, the bit-length is set to be the smallest one to store the maximum element in the vector.
- DirectAccessibleGammaCode: Direct accessible Gamma Code that uses a succinct select data structure to encode the bit-length part of Elias Gamma Code. Select data structures are switchable by template arguments.
- IncBitLenCode: A vector that uses lg(i + c) bits for the i-th element under the assuption that the i-th element of a given vector has a value at most i + c for a predefined constant c.
